## Blank typescript based hot-reloading phaser3 project
This was meant to be the very minimum necessary to start a project, will save you ~20mins of setting up things, maybe less, but not more than that.

Run it with `yarn dev` it serves on port 8080 with webpack-dev. I have other projects to thank for the webpack config and phaser type definitions.
